- I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://www.ece.unm.edu" target="_blank">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.unm.edu" target="_blank">The University of New Mexico, USA</a>, a student member of IEEE, the Vice Chair of IEEE Albuquerque Women in Engineering Affinity group, and a member of the PROTON lab, with <a href="http://ece-research.unm.edu/tsiropoulou/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. E.E.Tsiropoulou</a> as an advisor. 
- My major research field of interest is, and not limited to wireless communication networks, with interests in resource allocation and optimization in heterogeneous wireless networks using game theory, cognitive radio networks, network economics, Internet of Things (IoT), Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transmission (SWIPT). Currently, my focus is on Game theory and Advanced Learning techniques, which can be very powerful tools to understand the user needs to be coupled with their requirements of Quality of Service. My focus has been on applying the developed theoretical models in applications, such as Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT), wireless communications protocols for heliostats fields, and secure communications in smart grid systems.
- Before joining UNM, I received my Masterâ€™s Degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, <a href="https://cu.ac.bd" target="_blank">University of Chittagong</a>, Bangladesh, in July 2021. While obtaining my degree, I worked as a research assistant in <a href="https://sites.google.com/cu.ac.bd/wet-lab/overview" target="_blank">Wireless Emerging Technology Lab</a> at the University of Chittagong.
