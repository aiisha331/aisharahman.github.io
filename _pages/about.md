- I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://www.ece.unm.edu" target="_blank">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.unm.edu" target="_blank">The University of New Mexico, USA</a>, a student member of IEEE, the Chair of <a href="https://r6.ieee.org/albuquerque-wie/" target="_blank">IEEE Albuquerque Women in Engineering Affinity group</a>, and a member of the PROTON lab, with <a href="http://ece-research.unm.edu/tsiropoulou/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. E.E.Tsiropoulou</a> as an advisor. Before joining UNM, I received my Masterâ€™s Degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, <a href="https://cu.ac.bd" target="_blank">University of Chittagong</a>, Bangladesh, in July 2021. While obtaining my degree, I worked as a research assistant in <a href="https://sites.google.com/cu.ac.bd/wet-lab/overview" target="_blank">Wireless Emerging Technology Lab</a> at the University of Chittagong. 
- My major research field of interest is, and not limited to Wireless Networks, Online Social Networks (OSNs), Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), and Smart Grid Systems. I am currently conducting research to find effective solutions for resource optimization in interdependent systems such as 5G/6G Wireless Heterogenous Networks, Information Centric Networks, Smart Grid Systems, etc. through employing game theory, optimization techniques, and advanced learning techniques.
- As a Woman in Technology, I have been awarded the Cadence Diversity Scholarship 2022. I have also been awarded the IEEE Outstanding Service Award 2023 as a recognition of my service as the Chair of <a href="https://r6.ieee.org/albuquerque-wie/" target="_blank">IEEE Women in Engineering Affinity Group Albuquerque Section</a> at <a href="https://r6.ieee.org/albuquerque-wie/" target="_blank">.
